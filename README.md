You can visit the Swagger documentation to explore all the available routes

Also try to visit update routes using postman or something like that as it is throwing error when all the parameters are not provide in the body

You can access the routes under the "user" endpoint without authentication. For all other routes, authentication is required. To execute these routes, you need to provide a token with the request. Ensure that you include the word "Bearer" followed by a space before the token in the authorization header. When using Swagger, you don't need to manually type the "Bearer" keyword, as it will automatically include it for you.
